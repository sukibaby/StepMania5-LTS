/*
 * -------------------------- NOTE --------------------------
 *
 * This driver needs user read/write access to the icedragon.io stac.
 * This can be achieved by using a udev rule like this:
 *
 * (player 1 then player 2)
 * SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="04d8", ATTRS{idProduct}=="eb5b", OWNER="dance", GROUP="dance", MODE="0660"
 * SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="04d8", ATTRS{idProduct}=="eb5a", OWNER="dance", GROUP="dance", MODE="0660"
 *
 * Refer to your distribution's documentation on how to properly apply a udev rule.
