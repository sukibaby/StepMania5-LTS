 * -------------------------- NOTE --------------------------
 *
 * This driver needs user read/write access to PacDrive.
 * This can be achieved by using a udev rule like this:
 *
 * SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="D209", ATTRS{idProduct}=="1500", OWNER="dance", GROUP="dance", MODE="0660"
 *
 * Refer to your distribution's documentation on how to properly apply a udev rule.
